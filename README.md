## Standalone Start Page Features

**Data Persistence Guaranteed:**

- No internet required - Works completely offline
- Automatic saving - Every change (add, edit, delete, reorder) is saved immediately
- Browser storage - Data stays until you manually clear it

**What Protects Your Data:**

- localStorage is persistent and survives:
- Browser restarts
- Computer reboots
- Browser updates
- Power outages
- Internet disconnections

**Extra Safety Features:**

- Export function - Download backup files anytime
- Import function - Restore from backups if needed
- Data validation - Checks data integrity on load

**Bottom Line:**

Your links are as safe as your browser bookmarks - they'll persist indefinitely unless you intentionally delete them. The standalone page is actually more reliable than cloud-based solutions since it doesn't depend on external services or internet connectivity.
**Pro tip:** Export your data periodically as a backup file for extra peace of mind.
